<p>With paving of sidewalk tile and blocks besides the 
qualitative performance of works it is necessary to develop such 
project of paving, which will appear most aesthetically and it will be
entered in the general design of the surrounding space. In this 
case it is necessary to consider both the wishes of customer and 
limitations, which escape from the technical characteristics of the 
selected tile.</p>
<p>In the general case with the design of paving 
sidewalk tile it is necessary to consider these conditions:
<ul>
<li>Selection of the form of the tile
<li>Selection of pattern, i.e., the method of paving 
the tile
<li>To leave place, for example, for the flower bed
<li>The tiles of the specific color must lie on the 
boundary of section
<li>Colored tiles must be encountered in the section, 
forming the repetitive pattern
<li>Possibly, customer still itself was not determined 
with the form of tile and will make a selection before very beginning 
the paving
<li>Approaching the work, necessary to know how much 
will be required the tiles in all, and how many of them colored. 
But also how many halves and in turn, how many of them the 
colored
<li>And still it would be rather well draw sketch 
maximally approximating the original so that the customer would 
confirm that he had in the form precisely THIS THING
</ul></p>
<p>
It is obvious that the composition of paper sketch or 
drawing of a similar project of paving sidewalk tile will be very 
labor-consuming process. But its correction with the purpose to 
try pave with the diverse variants of block paving becomes the 
task, impracticable practically.</p>
<p>
It is also obvious that the automation of the design of paving 
sidewalk tile will significantly reduce the time of the development of
design and gives the possibility to compose several alternative 
designs and selection of them of the best. Moreover, draft can 
be drawn up in the presence of customer with his direct participation.
We represent the program "designer of sidewalk tile", which 
fulfills all enumerated functions. <a href="2.0/productinfo.html">It is in more detail...</a></p>

<td>1. In the pattern all the tiles of one form can be replaced by the tiles of another form.<br>
Possible use – when you create in program the tiles of the same form but with different thickness. In this case it’s possible to create the copy of the pattern with new name assigned and change one kind of tiles to another.<br>
2. Undo/Redo for colors setting in pattern coloring.<br>
3. In project Editor while working with multiple projects it's possible to switch between the projects by clicking the right button of the mouse.

A project can control its own edges for correct joining. It seeks edges whose ends is not joined to
