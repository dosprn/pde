Edging runs along the boundaries of the project. Usually the curb is laid on the borders, 
but you can place there decorative items as well. Later, we’ll consider curb as a special case.<br>
But now we proceed with edging. Edging should be created for each contour line of the project. 
Each piece of edging is a separate project that is added to a set of projects on creation. 
Therefore, before creating the border you need to put a mark "Add new and opened projects to set." 
Choose "Select graphic element" tool on the toolbar. <img src="selarrow.bmp">.<br> 
First, draw the outer contour edging of the project. As part of explanations on creating edgings 
let’s call it a <i>major</i> project.<br>
Press the right mouse button on the lower boundary of the contour. The boundary will be selected 
and popup-menu will be open for it as for each selected graphic element.
<div align="center"><img src="popupmenu.png"></div><br>
Choose "Create an edging". Window on creating edging will be opened.
<div align="center"><img src="createborder1.png"></div><br>
First of all we see a <i>schematic</i> representation of the boundary of the main project, 
for which we draw the edging. In the diagram border length and width of the line is not shown 
in the real size. The scheme is necessary only to show the location and shape of the edging's ends. 
The only real option is angle of slope. It is the same as in draft. This is done to facilitate the 
orientation of the pattern. Start of the line is indicated by the blue square, end - white.<br>
Some theory. We have already said that edging is just one more project. Consequently it has its 
limits. Edging borders create a quadrangle with one of its sides based on the selected border of the 
main project. Edging borders are always drawn clockwise either from the beginning of the selected 
edges of the main project or from the end. Let’s go to the practice. Enter the border width. 
In this example it is 200 mm. But the size in this window is of the same units as in the main 
project. Therefore in the field "Width" enter "0.2". 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder2.png"></div><br>
In accordance with the settings the edging border drew clockwise from start on the defined boundary 
of the main project. If you specify to draw from the end, the border will be drawn to the other side: 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder3.png"></div><br>
But we do not need it; return it to the original state.<br>
Indents we will considered later.<br>
Let’s proceed with angles. Using them you can make different kinds of conjugation of edging fragments. 
We enter "45" in both fields 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder4.png"></div><br>
Note that the angles are measured not like everywhere in the program. 
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="measureangle.png"></td>
<td align="center"><img src="measureangle3.png"></td>
<td align="center"><img src="measureangle2.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">The program always measures the angle from the horizontal axis directed to the right. 
Thus, the size of the angle always increases counterclockwise.</td>
<td align="center" colspan="2">In the mount the angle just shows angle between the base and 
the butt end of the edging. Angle direction does not matter.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
Let's experiment with angles to illustrate the mentioned above. Enter "-30" in the field 
"at start of edge" and "120" in the field "at end of edge". 
<div align="center"><img src="demoangles2.png"></div><br>
As you can see, at the edging end the angle of 120 is laid off the base. What happens at the edging 
start, where is a negative angle of -30? There angle was created from the <i>continuation</i> of a base.<br> 
Continue edging building. Return value "45" to both ends. Press <img src="open.bmp">,
select the name of the file, where to save the mount project. We’ll call it "Edging 1".<br>
Next you need to choose a pattern. The selected pattern is displayed in the upper left corner of the 
scheme, as well as in the Project Editor. Especially for this example a pattern of tiles 
"Brick 100x200" was created, it can be placed in the edging across the bottom.
<div align="center"><img src="createborder5.png"></div><br>
As we said at the beginning of this chapter it is impossible to fill mount by pattern directly 
on the diagram, as size and scale are not observed in the diagram. Therefore you will have to 
manipulate pattern "at random".<br>
The color can be immediately set for tile pattern. This can be done later when the project of edging 
will be created and added to the set of projects. However for this purpose you need to select it in 
a set, select all the tiles and set the color. In general it is easier to do it now. 
Press "Select Color". Choose from primary colors orange-brown one.  
<div align="center"><img src="colors.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="createborder6.png"></div><br>
A separate chapter is devoted to the work with colors. Since we do not need complementary colors 
we won't consider this topic now. Just to say that the default additional colors are loaded from 
the main project. If you need other complementary colors they can be downloaded immediately by 
clicking "Load colors".<br>
It is remained to rotate the pattern so that its angle of inclination will coincide with the 
inclination angle of the base. Since the base is located strictly horizontally leave "0" in the 
"Orientation" field. Now we are ready to create a edging. Click "OK". A new project is created. 
The program asks whether you want to save it. Save. We obtain the following in the projects window: 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder7.png"></div><br>
Here are two projects: the first - "layout", the second - "Edging 1". It is seen in the list of projects:
<div align="center"><img src="projectlist1.png"></div><br>
Note that after edge creation it didn’t become the active project. "Layout" left active. 
This is handy when you need to create a set of edgings. Continue doing the same thing.  
(To close the list of projects choose a project. Now we need a "layout", choose it with just one 
click).<br> 
We still have selected tool "Select graphic element". Press the right mouse button on the right 
edge of the layout. Choose "Create an edging". The window of mount creation opens. 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder8.png"></div><br>
Note that all parameters except the name of the project remained from last edging. T
hey suit us, except the pattern orientation. It should be rotated through 90&deg;. 
Enter "90" in the "Orientation". 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder9.png"></div><br>
We need assign a project name for mount. We call it "Edging 2". Click "OK". Now in the projects 
window are two edgings. 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder10.png"></div><br>
Create edging for the top border. Again you only need to change the orientation of the pattern. 
It must be 180&deg;. Project Title - "Edging 3". 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder11.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="createborder12.png"></div><br>
Create edging for the fourth boundary. The orientation should be 270&deg; (or -90&deg;, which is the same). 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder13.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="createborder14.png"></div><br>
Now let's create a border around the lawns. Let's start from the bottom. 
Here is more complicated case. Part of the lawn boundary is covered by mount. 
The figure below shows this boundary marked in red. 
<div align="center"><img src="createborder15.png"></div><br>
Highlight this line; call the window to create an edging. It looks like that after the previous border.
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder1.png"></div><br>
To start, you need to "turn" edging into the lawn. For this swap switch "Draw Borders clockwise" 
to "from the end." 
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder2.png"></div><br>
Next. Lower cut edging is direct. Therefore, set to the angle of 90&deg; at the end. 
Please note we have drawn from the end mount highlighted border of the main project. 
Therefore the beginning of the highlighted mount (blue square) and edging start do not match. 
Therefore, we introduced the "90" <i>at the end</i>.<br> 
Boundary of the lawn interfaced at 135 degrees. Therefore, the corner near the edging base 
has to be 135/2 = 67,5&deg;. Remembering the above said about the beginning of the mount drawing, 
"67.5" must be entered in the field "at start of edge". 
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder3.png"></div><br>
Now you have to "retreat" from the bottom so that the lawn edging and edging of external borders 
do not overlap. For this we need padding. Width of the previously created edging - 200 mm. 
Do indentation by the same amount. Or according the dimension of 0.2 meters. It must be entered 
in indentation field "at end od edge". 
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder4.png"></div><br>
The orientation of the pattern should be 270. This value is left from the last time. Leave it like that.<br> 
Choose a file name for the project. Let it be "Bottom edging 1". Click "OK". 
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder5.png"></div><br>
Continue to create edging clockwise. For the following mount corners near the base are 67,5&deg;, 
without spaces. Orientation of the pattern  is -135&deg;. 
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder6.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder7.png"></div><br>
Next edging. Angles around the bases 67,5&deg;, without spaces, orientation of the pattern 180&deg;. 
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder8.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder9.png"></div><br>
Next edging. Angles around the bases 67,5&deg;, without spaces, orientation of the pattern 135&deg;. 
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder10.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder11.png"></div><br>
Last mount is lower the lawn. By analogy with the first you need different angles near the base at the 
beginning and end. 
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder12.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="bottomborder13.png"></div><br>
We now turn to the top lawn. There we will do more complex mount linking. We need a bit of geometry. 
Let's start with the left border. 
<div align="center"><img src="topborder1.png"></div><br>
That are supposed edging options if we were not going to do complex conjugation. Recall geometry. 
<div align="center"><img src="geometry.png"></div><br>
<div align="center">cos A = w &#8260; L &nbsp;&#8658;&nbsp; L = w &#8260; cos A</div><br>
In this case, w - is a width of the mount, the angle A is 45&deg;. 
So indent L = 0,2 / cos 45&deg; = 0,283 (rounded to three decimal places). 
Enter this value in the indentation field "at the mount end". Orientation should be 270&deg;. 
<div align="center"><img src="topborder2.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="topborder3.png"></div><br>
Go to the next border. Indentation at the edging end should be placed on the same logic as in the 
previous step. 
<div align="center"><img src="topborder4.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="topborder5.png"></div><br>
Next edging is symmetric and without spaces at the ends. 
<div align="center"><img src="topborder6.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="topborder7.png"></div><br>
Next edging is similar to the second. 
<div align="center"><img src="topborder8.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="topborder9.png"></div><br>
The last element of mount is similar to the first. 
<div align="center"><img src="topborder10.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="topborder11.png"></div><br>
We now turn to the edgings of two squares. We will not match the corners. 
At the corners we will place four halves, folded into a square. 
Highlight the bottom border of the left square. 
<div align="center"><img src="qborder1.png"></div><br>
Since corners will have another masonry add indents of 200mm at the beginning and the end. 
The angles at the ends should be 90&deg;. 
<div align="center"><img src="qborder2.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="qborder3.png"></div><br>
Next, choose the left border of the same square. 
<div align="center"><img src="qborder4.png"></div><br>
<div align="center"><img src="qborder5.png"></div><br>
Next you need to draw a corner. This will be a separate project, just 200x200 mm and four tiles. 
To draw it we do not need to calculate coordinates. You can outline it in layout and mount borders. 
Zoom to accurately hit the mouse to the reference points. In the figure below the reference points 
are shown in red. 
<div align="center"><img src="qborder6.png"></div><br>
Create a new project (button <img src="new.bmp">). Please note, in the list of projects a draft 
"Untitled" became active. Select instrument "polyline" and draw a square on the reference points. 
Save the project under the name "Corner edging". The pattern of square tiles 100x100mm is designed 
especially for this angle. On the picture below you can see how it is made. 
Fill the corner by this pattern.  
<div align="center"><img src="qborder7.png"></div><br>
Since the project is filled by gray tiles by default, it is necessary to change the color of the tiles. 
How to <a href="../main/main.html#colorpattern">change the color</a> will be discussed later in details. 
This question is fully described in <a href="/2.0/help/index.html?colorandtextures.html">the reference manual</a>. 
Choose the tool "Select tile" and select all four tiles. Call the color picker dialogue and choose 
the same color for the edging. 
<div align="center"><img src="colors.png"></div><br>
Clear the selection (tool <img src="dropselection.bmp">). Now edging corner is the same as the entire edging. 
<div align="center"><img src="qborder9.png"></div><br>
Reduce the scale so you can see the entire square. 
<div align="center"><img src="qborder10.png"></div><br>
If you look closely, you can see that the upper boundary edging repeats bottom edging and 
left border edging repeats right one. And the same is for all four corners. 
All of them together are the same as edgings for other square. Is there any other way but <i>to draw</i> 
the remaining mounts? Yes - <a href="../cloning/cloning.html">cloning</a>.<br>
<h3 align="center">Save a set of projects with the "Save set of projects"!</h3>
After creating all the edgings and their clones you can proceed to <a href="../main/main.html">the working draft main space tiles filling.</a>
