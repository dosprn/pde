In version 2.2, several projects can be placed in the same drawing. These conventional projects 
are completely independent from each other, each of them has its own circuit and pattern. 
The only thing uniting them - is that they are placed in a single drawing. Of course, each of them 
can be opened and edited separately from the others.<br>
Suppose you need to draw the next working draft: 
<div align="center"><img src="example.bmp"></div><br>
There are TWO projects. 
<table width="100%" align="center">
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="externalproject.bmp"></td>
<td align="center"><img src="internalproject.bmp"></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">First - outer square</td><td align="center">Second - internal</td></tr>
</table>
This means you need to draw in the one project ALL the borders of the outer square (marked in red), 
and in other project - ALL internal borders (blue).<br><br>
All projects placed in the drawing are combined into <i>a set</i>. In a set you can switch between the projects. 
Currently selected project becomes <i>active</i>. You can edit it. Other projects are unavailable for editing at this time.<br>
Look at our example. As far as the drawing can place several projects, when drawing complex work projects 
you can create one basic project that will serve as basis for drawing the remaining projects. 
In our case the basic design can be like this: 
<div align="center"><img src="maket.png"></div><br>
First of all you should establish comfortable <a href="../draftparams/draftparams.html">drawing dimensions</a>. 
Further in the examples scale is set in "1".<br> 
Begin to draw. Click the <b>New</b> <img src="new.bmp"> button on the toolbar. 
A new project "Untitled" is created in the Project Editor. 
It is added to the set of projects that consists only of this one: 
<div align="center"><img src="newproject.png"></div><br>
Note that other buttons become available in the toolbar. Draw a basic design. 
Drawing is described in details in <a href="/2.0/help/index.html?drawprimitives.html">the manual</a>. 
In version 2.2, you can also draw <a href="../drawwithdialog/drawwithdialog.html">with help of the dialogue</a>.
Save the base project called "layout".  
<div align="center"><img src="maket1.png"></div><br>
Now according the layout we will create outer borders <a href="../edges/edges.html">edgings</a> of the working draft, 
squares and lawns.
Each line of the edging - is a separate project, which is added to a set of projects on creation. 
Working draft with edgings looks like this: 
<div align="center"><img src="withedges.png"></div><br>
And here is how a set of projects looks like:
<div align="center"><img src="projectset1.png"></div><br>
Now it's time to fill in the working draft with tiles. Taking into account the beginning of this chapter about projects borders, 
draw the <a href="../main/main.html">inner space project</a> and fill it with tiles.
Working with multiple projects in a single drawing you need to closely monitor which of the project 
is now active. There is a risk to start drawing in the wrong project. So, we created the edgings in 
the project "layout". If you do not create a new project for the inner space, then you can easily start drawing right 
in "layout". Thatâ€™s why, <h2 align="center">do not forget to create new projects for the individual parts of a working project!</h2>
<div align="center"><img src="main.png"></div><br>
You also need to save a set of projects after completing the current project. 
Imagine that after creating the border we saved a set of projects under the name "Lesson 1". 
Then we drew a project "inner space", as shown above. After that we decided to make a break in 
a work and closed the program. When you need to continue your work on the detailed design, 
just open a set of projects. Click "Open set" and select the file "Lesson 1". 
Get layout with borders, but without an inner space. The matter is we forgot to save a set after 
adding "inner space" before:
<div align="center"><img src="withedges.png"></div><br>
It is easy to fix. Select "New and open projects add to the set" and just open the project "inner space." 
Now everything looks good. 
<div align="center"><img src="main.png"></div><br>
Now we need to save the set - we just added the project "inner space" to it.
Next time everything will be opened together.<br>
Create a project to fill the <a href="../quadrangles/quadrangles.html">squares</a>. Draw squares.
<div align="center"><img src="full.png"></div>
Again, save the set.<br>
So, working on multiple projects in a single drawing you must adhere to the following procedure:
<ol>
<li>Create a new project
<li>Draw the project
<li>Save the project
<li>Save a set of projects
<li>Before you change the project make sure that active project is that you are going to change.
</ol>
<a name="deleteprojectfromset">Needless project can be removed from the set. For this purpose it is 
necessary to make it active and click "Remove from the set" <img src="deletesomething.bmp"> 
on the right of the set of projects. And save a set of projects.<br>
<br>
Proceed to the <a href="../final/final.html">working project final processing</a>.
