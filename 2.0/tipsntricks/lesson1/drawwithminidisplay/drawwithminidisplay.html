Suppose you need to draw a line over the blue lines of the layout:
<div align="center"><img src="drawwithminidisplay1.png"></div><br>
At a small scale it is difficult to get to the reference points by mouse. 
If you zoom it the ends of the reference line may be beyond the screen and drawing a line from end 
to end will be impossible:
<div align="center"><img src="drawwithminidisplay2.png"></div><br>
There is a solution - a mini-display. Push the button <img src="minidisplay.bmp"> on the toolbar. 
A pane with a miniature copy of the working draft will appear on the workspace:
<div align="center"><img src="minidisplay1.png"></div><br>
It is important to pre-install the comfortable <a href="../draftparams/draftparams.html">size of the drawing</a>.
If the size of the drawing will be too big for the project, the mini-display will be uninformative:
<div align="center"><img src="minidisplaynotuseful.png"></div><br>
Begin to draw contours. Do not forget to create a new project for the interior space of a working project!<br>
Choose the tool "Polyline" <img src="zigzag.bmp">. And click the mouse on the mini-display 
in the lower left corner (circled in red):
<div align="center"><img src="minidisplay2.png"></div><br>
On the workspace you will see a part of the project, corresponding to the clicking point on the mini- display. 
Position accuracy depends on the clicking point on the mini-display. 
<div align="center"><img src="drawwithminidisplay3.png"></div><br>
Finally begin to draw the first line. Click at the starting point (on the figure above it is circled 
in red). The line will be pulled from this point:
<div align="center"><img src="drawwithminidisplay4.png"></div><br>
Click on the mini-display at the end of the line: 
<div align="center"><img src="minidisplay3.png"></div><br>
The project will move to this position on the working area:
<div align="center"><img src="drawwithminidisplay5.png"></div><br>
Finish the line. As far as we draw a polyline, a new line begins at that point. 
Push the next point on the mini-display: 
<div align="center"><img src="minidisplay4.png"></div><br>
The project has moved to the point we need. We complete the line.
<div align="center"><img src="drawwithminidisplay6.png"></div><br>
Continue doing the same for each reference point of circuit until finishing.
<br>

Mini-display can be dragged to any workspace location, as well as any other window using the title. 
You can change its size, as well as any other window by pulling the sides or corners.
