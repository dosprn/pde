<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">All written below are added or fixed since version 2.0 was released.

<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:12pt; color:#000000"><b>Version 2.2</b></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
<br>

<br>
<b>Added:
<br>
</b><b>
<br>
</b>It is possible to place some projects on a singe draft. Every project is a separate project with its own outlines and pattern. When project is creating or opening, it can be added to a set of projects. To select another project from a set it is needed to save current project. Set of projects may be saved. When set of projects are opening, all projects are opening simultaneously.
<br>

<br>
Project can be moved along coordinate axis on specified range. See main menu "Plot"-"Move the project". It is useful if you place some projects on single draft and adust its positions.
<br>

<br>
All projects placed on a draft can be exported in BMP-picture. Export is performed in current scale. See main menu "Projects"-"Export a presentation".
<br>

<br>
It is posiible to create an edge along project's outline. Select an outline, specify width, indents and angles of coupling at the ends, pattern and tile's color. Edge creates as separate project.
<br>

<br>
It is posiible to create clones of project. Clones are placed on the same draft, but is not an object of "material world". There is no way to change its outline, pattern or tile's color. They are changed when parent project is changed.
<br>

<br>
Defined colors can be saved and loaded. This are "Customs colors" in "Color" dialog.
<br>

<br>
It is possible to define some custom skins. Skin is color map of pattern's tiles. Project can be filled with selected skin.
<br>

<br>
Color for drawing tiles outlines can be specified in "Settings". So, now it is not black only.
<br>

<br>
As you now, while moving mouse pointer over draft, current coordinates are rounded to the nearest junctions of the coordinate grid. To avoid this press and hold Ctrl. Accurate positioning is achieved in that way. In contrast, tool "Select graphic element" never rounds coordinates. It makes few inconvenience during moving graphic element on integer amount coordinate points. Now holding Ctrl have contrary effect for that tool - rounding coordinates.<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#FF0000">
<br>
</span></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
<br>
While drawing segment or polyline right mouse button in combination with Shift key calls popup menu, and then dialog, which helps to draw segment from current mouse position to point, specified by absolute or relative coordinates. If drawn object is polyline, dialog stay opened and next segment can be dranw from end of previous segment.
<br>

<br>
<b>Fixed</b>:
<br>

<br>
Opening and saving of large projects executes much quickly.
<br>

<br>
Error message about collided layers during filling appeared without reason. Now error appear only if filling layers collide indeed.
<br>

<br>
If start point is placed exactly on the outline and first pattern is paved on the outside of paving area, then filling breaks. Now the program searches a way to fill area.
<br>

<br>
In some conditions a part's contour does not match a corresponging fragment of a tile. Bugfix is in progress.
<br>

<br>
<b>Interface improvements:
<br>
</b>
<br>
Pattern name fills all available area in open/save dialog.
