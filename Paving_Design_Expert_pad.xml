      <Char_Desc_2000>With paving of sidewalk tile and blocks besides the qualitative performance of works it is necessary to develop such project of paving, which will appear most aesthetically and it will be entered in the general design of the surrounding space. In this case it is necessary to consider both the wishes of customer and limitations, which escape from the technical characteristics of the selected tile.

In the general case with the design of paving sidewalk tile it is necessary to consider these conditions:
Selection of the form of the tile
Selection of pattern, i.e., the method of paving the tile
To leave place, for example, for the flower bed
The tiles of the specific color must lie on the boundary of section
Colored tiles must be encountered in the section, forming the repetitive pattern
Possibly, customer still itself was not determined with the form of tile and will make a selection before very beginning the paving
Approaching the work, necessary to know how much will be required the tiles in all, and how many of them colored. But also how many halves and in turn, how many of them the colored
And still it would be rather well draw sketch maximally approximating the original so that the customer would confirm that he had in the form precisely THIS THING
It is obvious that the composition of paper sketch or drawing of a similar project of paving sidewalk tile will be very labor-consuming process. But its correction with the purpose to try pave with the diverse variants of block paving becomes the task, impracticable practically.

It is also obvious that the automation of the design of paving sidewalk tile will significantly reduce the time of the development of design and gives the possibility to compose several alternative designs and selection of them of the best. Moreover, draft can be drawn up in the presence of customer with his direct participation. We represent the program 'designer of sidewalk tile', which fulfills all enumerated functions.</Char_Desc_2000>
